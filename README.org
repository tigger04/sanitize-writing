* Sanitize Writing Script
A Perl script that processes text files to replace specified patterns.

** Description
This script applies word-based pattern replacements defined in a configuration file

** Prerequisites
- Perl 5
- Required Perl modules:
  - File::Copy
  - File::Basename
  - Cwd
  - Getopt::Long

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./sanitize-writing.pl --template=CONFIG_FILE [options] text_file
#+END_SRC

*** Options
- =--template=CONFIG_FILE= :: Path to the configuration file containing replacement patterns
- =-b, --backup= :: Create a backup of the original file before processing
- =--backup-file=FILENAME= :: Specify custom backup filename (optional, requires -b)
- =text_file= :: Path to the text file to be processed

*** Configuration File Format
The configuration file should contain replacement patterns in the following format:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
search=replace
#+END_SRC

Each line defines a single replacement rule:
- Empty lines are ignored
- Lines starting with # are treated as comments
- Patterns are case-insensitive
- Words are matched with word boundaries

Example configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
# Replace common abbreviations
govt=government
dept=department
#+END_SRC

** Features
- Optional backup creation with -b flag
  - Default backup uses =.bak= extension
  - Custom backup filename supported
- Word boundary matching to prevent partial word replacements
- assumes UTF-8 encoding
- Preserves original file on error

** Error Handling
The script will exit with an error message if:
- Required files are missing
- Command-line arguments are incorrect
- File operations fail

** Output
- Reports each successful pattern replacement with count
- Creates backup files when requested
- Displays completion message

** Examples
Process a document using a custom template:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./sanitize-writing.pl --template=my_rules.conf document.txt
#+END_SRC

Create backup with default name (.bak extension):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./sanitize-writing.pl --template=my_rules.conf -b document.txt
#+END_SRC

Create backup with custom filename:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./sanitize-writing.pl --template=my_rules.conf -b --backup-file=document.backup.txt document.txt
#+END_SRC

** Files
- =sanitize-writing.pl= :: Main script
- =CONFIG_FILE= :: User-provided replacement patterns
  - See =words-uk-to-us.txt= and =words-us-to-uk.txt= as examples
    (British to American and American to British English word replacements)
